//TODO, what everyone is currently working on


File reading (Sai) :

  -Call graph functions to fill the graph based on inputs: 
      public EdgeWeightedDigraph(int V) = V is the number of Vertices
      createEdge(int from, int to, int weight) = from is the start vertice, to is the end vertice, weight is the cost from the start to end
      
  -Store stop_times.txt and transfer.txt

  -you can use mark's function if you want in readBusStations.java for stops.txt, or make your own


TST (Mark):

  -splitting and storing the names of stops by character in a ternary search tree


ShortestPath (Pascal):

  -Dijkstra using graph data

SearchFortrips (Nathan):
  
  -searches for trips based on specific arrival time critera as input by user


Main(commandLine) (tbd):
  user can pass specific arguments to make the program do specific functions as stated in the design specifications
